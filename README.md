# Word Search Generator C
## What is it?
This is a simple C library I've written that generates a word search and either prints it to the terminal or saves it to a file.
## Why?
I'm writing this to practice C and Git. I'm primarily focusing on learning how to parse command-line arguments and handle file I/O, and I thought this would be a good project to achieve that.
